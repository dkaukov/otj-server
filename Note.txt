The idea of this is to split up to allow different supported stuff

Core - The core code (duh)
jaxrs - jaxrs specific
mvc - mvc specific
reactive (future) - reactive stuff
shared-test - core shared test framework (so you can repeat tests)
server - uses maven relocation to relocate to otj-server-jaxrs(*)


TODO:

- Further tune MVC
- Add otj-rest-template - I say no, but if you do, cyclic dependencies abound
- Add conserved headers, etc to mvc. Check metrics, and logging, etc.
- verify JAXRS works and compatibility below
- reorganize tests
- should we make this repo private and again and "un opensource it" - otherwise, it will keep getting "bigger"

Compatibility

- Peoples deps will change, but the annotation and compile should mostly work
- RestHttpServer annotation works but is deprecated. Folkd should choose the appropriate annotation
for JaxRs or MVC
- The old otj-server dependency is "wrong". We've set up a maven relocator to semi-transparently relocate, but
dependency checker will flag this.

Migration:

JaxRS users (if you were using otj stack before this is PROBABLY you):

- Remove otj-server dependency and add otj-server-core & otj-server-jaxrs dependencies
- Change annotation from @RestHttpServer to @JaxRSServer

MVC users:

- Remove otj-server dependency and add otj-server-core & otj-server-mvc dependencies
- Change annotation from @RestHttpServer to @MVCServer

If you want to use both:
- Use both annotations!
- Use otj-server-core, otj-server-mvc, otj-server-jaxrs
