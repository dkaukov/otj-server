The idea of this is to split up to allow different supported stuff

Core - The core code (duh)
jaxrs - jaxrs specific
mvc - mvc specific
reactive (future) - reactive stuff
shared-test - core shared test framework (so you can repeat tests)
server - can use maven relocation to move otj-server to ojt-server-jaxrs


other undone things

- Add otj-rest-template - I say no, but if you do, cyclic dependencies abound
- Add conserved headers, etc to mvc

Compatibility

- Peoples deps will change, but the annotation and compile should mostly work
